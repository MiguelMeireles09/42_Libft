Libft
ðŸ“š Overview

Libft is a custom implementation of the C standard library functions, designed as the foundational project at 42 School. It includes not only the essential functions but also additional utilities for future development needs. Over time, I expanded this library by integrating my own implementations of ft_printf and get_next_line, creating a versatile and reusable library for future projects.
